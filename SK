#Maybe Change process of the punishment command for staff to /menu, (still giving staff pixelors.mod or whatever permission)
#and in there choosing the Staff icon. There they choose the punishment or moderation item. If punishment it opens the
#(online) players heads menu, with 1 button for back and 1 for Type Offline Player. If type offline player, it opens an
#anvil and goes to the next step...the same one the player heads menu of online players goes. That next menu might be a
#time menu if temporary ban/mute, the next step is an anvil to type the reason for the punishment. It shows a finalized
#review menu to Approve, Cancel, or Edit Name or Reason or Punishment or time. OOOORRRR have presets and they choose the
#reason preset, with the option to add multiple reasons. Each of those reasons could be multiple which they have different
#punishments to get more & more severe.

# FUTURE UPDATES

# -Tell Staff that talk while chat is stopped, that they bypassed it!
